# Feature-Engineering-of-a-Transport-System

This feature engineering project involves the analysis of a train map structure to extract features which can be used to uncover hidden details and determine different areas of focus. 
For example, extracting features such as traffic density at a station across a time period can help determine alternate paths that a commuter can take to reach their destination at a shorter period of time.

This project utilises concepts such as graph theory, network theory and eigen-decomposition to extract features. For more details on the project, please read the report and check out the Jupyter Notebook for the relevant codes used in this project.
